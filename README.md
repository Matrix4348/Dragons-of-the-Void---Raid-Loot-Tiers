# Dragons of the Void - Raid Loot Tiers

</div>

*Dragons of the Void - Raid Loot Tiers* is a user script that I made for the game *Dragons of the Void* and provides data collected by the players (like raid tiers), directly in the game. To install it, please go to [Greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/450685-dragons-of-the-void-raid-loot-tiers).

Its development takes place on this repository. If you want to contribute in a way or another, [read the documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md).
