## Updating game-related data

All data collected by the players is located in the ["community-gathered data" folder](documentation/community-gathered-data.md). 

## Updating the code of the user script

All data related to the user script code is located in the ["user script" folder](documentation/updating-user-script.md).

## Updating the documentation

The documentation comprises [README.md](README.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the ["documentation" folder](documentation). If you find any error, technical inaccuracy, grammatical error or if you think that you can improve it, feel free to suggest your changes.<br>
All of these files support [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) and a lot of HTML. [This guide](https://github.com/9EED/Markdown-guide) covers almost all formatting available on GitHub and is pretty clean.
