# How to change a file on someone's repository?

</div>

## Updating a file
### If you do not have write-access to the repository, then to modify files you will need to:
1) create a fork (click the "Fork" button at the top of the page)
2) edit the files
3) create a pull request

Once approved, the pull request will be merged and your changes will be applied.<br>

### If you have write access, then you have three possibilities:
* creating a fork (if none exists), editing files there and creating a pull request
* creating a branch on this repository (click the current branch name next to the number of existing branches, enter a name and create it), then editing files and opening a pull request
* updating the files directly

Even though pull requests can easily be reverted and have other upsides, going through this hassle is usually not necessary (here). Choose what you find the most convenient.

## Updating several files at once
You cannot change several files at once from github.com, but you can do so from github.dev: simply replace the former domain with the latter in the repository address and you will discover an interface that is far more convenient for updating files, especially folder renaming.

## Commit messages
The default commit message suggested by GitHub is often enough, but in some cases you might want to type a more detailed head and body for this message. On the contrary, if you merge a pull request, you may want to clear the automatically-generated body.
As a general rule, do as you believe is the best choice.
