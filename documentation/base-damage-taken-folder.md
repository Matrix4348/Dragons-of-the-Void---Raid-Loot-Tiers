# Base damage taken

</div>

These files contain damage type and damage values for each raid on each difficulty. <br>
If a raid does not exist on all difficulties while there is a column for another difficulty, then leave the cells for the missing difficulties empty.

> [!Note]
> Someday™️, the script will not only display base damage taken, but also calculate actual damage taken.
> This dream will become true once #14 has been resolved.
