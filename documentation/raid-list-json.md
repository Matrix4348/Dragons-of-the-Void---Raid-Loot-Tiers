# raid_list.json

raid_list.json is the file that the user script fetches the raid data from. It is automatically updated any time a relevant file is, then uploaded to https://matrix4348.github.io/dragons-of-the-void/raid_list.json.<br>
You should not touch it. Any manual change made to it would end up being automatically overwritten, anyway.
