# Basic data

</div>

These files contain basic information about raids. It is important to know that only raids added here will by displayed by the script.<br>

Not all columns are present everywhere, because sometimes they are completely irrelevant.

About what to input in a few columns:
* Raid name: Type the <ins>exact same</ins> name that is displayed in the game
* Health on X: it is the health of the raid on difficulty X (obviously...)
* "On-hit drops?", "Loot expansion?" and other columns related to loot skills : "Yes", "No" or "?" (exact levels of each skill, when they matter, will be added elsewhere)
