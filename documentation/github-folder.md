# The .github folder

</div>

The .github folder has everything (file-wise) that manages the repository, especially its automation.

## GitHub actions

GitHub actions are lines of code that run on specific events, like when a file is modified. You will find them in `.github/workflows`. They often run scripts, which you will find in `.github/scripts`. I write mines in Python but they can be written in many programming languages.

.gitignore?
