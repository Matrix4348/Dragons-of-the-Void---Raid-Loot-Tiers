# The "On-hit drops" folder

The files in this folder contain keen eye levels required for each raid on each difficulty. Only add raids that have at least one on-hit drop in one difficulty.<br>

If something drops, then input these levels like studious inspector does ("KE3, KE7", for example) if you know them or a question mark if you do not.<br>
If nothing drops, leave empty.<br>
If you ignore the answer to this question, input a question mark.<br>

If a raid does not exist on all difficulties, then leave the cells for the missing difficulties empty if they exist.
