# Community-gathered data

</div>

All the data collected by the players and displayed by the user script is located in this folder.

It contains the following files and folder:
* [Basic data](basic-data-folder.md)
* [Base damage taken](base-damage-taken-folder.md)
* [Loot tiers and drop data](loot-tiers-folder.md)
* [On-hit drops](on-hit-drops-folder.md)
* [Notes.csv](notes-csv.md)

> [!WARNING]
> Most of the files that you will encounter are csv files. You can learn more about them [here](what-is-a-csv-file.md).

> [!NOTE]
> All relevant files are automatically merged into [docs/raid-list.json](raid-list-json.md), which is then automatically uploaded to a place that the script will fetch it from. The merging process occurs whenever those files get modified.
