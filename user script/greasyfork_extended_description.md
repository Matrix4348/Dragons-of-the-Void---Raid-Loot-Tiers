**Before installing this script, make sure you have installed (and enabled) a user script manager on your browser. At least one of the following extensions should be available for your browser: Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, Violentmonkey.**<br>
<u>Warning:</u>
* If you are using Greasemonkey 4 (only available for Firefox, I believe), then please be aware that this script will only work on play.dragonsofthevoid.com (due to how Greasemonkey 4 is built), so you should use another user script manager or an earlier version of Greasemonkey.
* On Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and probably other Chrome-derivated browsers, [Tampermonkey needs you to enable developer mode to use user scripts](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php#Q209).

With this user script, you will be able to look at the raid loot tiers for the game *Dragons of the Void* directly in-game, without having to open another tab. A "Raid tiers" button will appear alongside the other buttons at the top of the game, which will show or hide the tier list and a few filtering options ([illustration](https://prnt.sc/yhuOTLxBZNjg)). The loot tiers associated to any given raid will also be displayed inside said raid ([example](https://prnt.sc/4ql3UHA0s1yA)). How many common, rare and mythic drops are given for each tier can also be displayed, alongside any information related to bonus drops.

I do not take any credit for the data being displayed here. It is being discovered by the community and I gather it in my dedicated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Matrix4348/Dragons-of-the-Void---Raid-Loot-Tiers), from where it is being fetched by the script in real time. You can directly contribute there, if you want to. The development of the whole script also takes place there.

Please, report any bug or missing data here on Greasyfork (if you have an account), on GitHub (if you have an account...) or anywhere you might find me.
